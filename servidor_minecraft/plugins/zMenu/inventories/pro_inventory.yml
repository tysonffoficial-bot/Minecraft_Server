# Size (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/inventories#size)
#
# Allows to set the size of the inventory.
# The inventory size must be a multiple of 9. So you can put 9, 18, 27, 36, 45 and 54
# If this option is not present in the configuration, then the default will be 54
#
size: 45

# Inventory name (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/inventories#name)
#
# This is the title of your inventory. You can put anything in it.
# Color code and placeholders are supported.
# If you are on Paper, Purpur or PufferFish you have access to the color code of MiniMessage (https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html)
#
name: "#454545sʜᴏᴘ"

# View Requirement (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/requirements#view-requirement)
#
# Allows verification of different permissions when opening inventory. You can specify a list of requirements, details of requirements available on the plugin documentation.
# You will then be able to define actions to be performed on success or deny.
#
# In the example if below, if the player to the permission "zmenu.shop.show" then the inventory will open, otherwise a message will be sent
#
open_requirement:
  requirements:
    - type: permission
      permission: "zmenu.shop.show"
  deny:
    - type: message
      messages:
        - "&cYou do not have permission to access the shop."

# Item section. (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/inventories#items)
#
# This is where you will add all the items that will be present in your inventory.
# With zMenu, each item is a Button. A button will allow you to perform specific actions, such as opening a new inventory, changing pages, going back.
# By default, the button will be of type NONE. All buttons will have the same configuration elements.
# Only buttons with types like INVENTORY, BACK etc... will have specific configuration elements.
# All button information here: https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/buttons
#
items:

  # Button with multiple slots (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/buttons#slot)
  #
  # You can define a button that will be displayed on multiple slots.
  # To put several slots, you must put as in the example if below. You must write "slots" and not "slot"
  # You’re going to have to put a slot list, but instead of putting each slot in sequence you can make slot range like this:
  # <start slot>-<end slot>, in the example below we have 2-6, which represents slots 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
  #
  # So we have red glass that will be displayed on all pages of slot 2 to 6
  slots:
    # Specifies whether the button should appear on all pages (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/buttons#is-permanent)
    is-permanent: true
    item:
      material: GRAY_STAINED_GLASS_PANE
      name: "&e"
    slots:
      - 0-9 # slot 0 to 9
      - 18
      - 17
      - 26
      - 27
      - 35-44 # slot 35 to 44

  #
  # The item if below will use the click_requirement and view_requirement.
  # You will have the same configuration items as for the open_requirement.
  # Attention, for the click_requirement you will have to define several requirements according to your need.
  # You also need to specify clicks. So you can create multiple requirements for each click.
  #
  # In the example if below, if the player has enough money, and he has the zmenu.shop.use permission then the item will be displayed, otherwise another item will be displayed.
  # And when clicking we will check again the money and the permission of the player before giving him the diamonds.
